## Team Collaboration (Pair Programming)**

### Step 1

One student should create a new repository and invite a team member as a collaborator.


### Step 2

The owner should create an `index.html` file and push it to `main`. 

### Step 3 

The collaborator should clone the repo, create a new branch (`update-styles`), and modify `index.html` by adding a `<style>` section.

### Step 4

The collaborator should commit and push the changes, then open a PR.
 
### Step 5 

The repository owner should review, approve, and merge the PR.

### Step 6
